The original Arduino MIDI device tutorial [can be found here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/MidiDevice)


Link to [example p5js Javascript program is here](https://editor.p5js.org/dbarrett/sketches/HJhBG-LI7)





A copy of the p5js will be hosted this this repository, as well as the Arduino sketch that will be loaded onto a compatible Arduino (and a separate directory for the Teensy LC microcontroller).
